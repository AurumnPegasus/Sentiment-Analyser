Authorising CMs to decide days and dates for lockdown by PM may prove disaster for India, more particularly states like Bengal where coronavirus is spreading fast but it has declared lifting of lockdown from 8th June. @narendramodi
@MamataOfficial Please reconsider this decision. I think this announcement could have been made more months later given the status of the corona virus. We are still in danger.@IamSumanDe @MoupiaNandy @Dhruba1972 @sardesairajdeep @Monideepa62 @TOIKolkata

#Fiddling the Nation, it's people and the pecuniary system. #Coronavirus lockdown | ‘Runaway’ trains haunt migrant workers - The Hindu 
This statement shows he will not #disinfect those #trains and keep using them, perhaps for the #MigrantWorkers, so that they get another #coronavirus whiplash. It all depends on who's travelling. Had it been a Rs 10 lakh family hiring a train, this dialogue would change.

Nooo, but they will squarely blame #coronavirus. Or say, when #GDP was supposed to be #negative, it is at 3.1%. The best bet is they will rework the current calculation system and show us 7% #GDP. But I guess it will take some time.
China should be accountable for the unprecedented contagion of #COVID19 globally. As they should not be very secretive about the first coronavirus epicenter in Wuhan. And the present situation of a tentative war between India and China delivers a possibility of global doldrum...

Well. It basically means that you're definitely going to catch coronavirus. But if you're asymptomatic then you wouldn't even know. Fever and cough has to treated at home. Hospitalization is only required if you need oxygen.
We still have the threat of coronavirus rising in the state. We remain at home for months together now. We do not know how long this plight will continue but are readry to face it in the modest way. @SriSri

According to the senior advisor @jaredkushner the coronavirus testing in last 60days has been increased by 100×. 60days ago we have tested 3,748 individuals. Today we have tested 394,711 individuals. This would not be possible without the decisive leadership of President Trump.
110 new #COVIDー19 cases were reported as of 8:00 AM on May 13 in WB, according to data released by the @MoHFW_INDIA. This brings the total reported cases of #coronavirus in Bengal to 2,173. Among the total people infected as on date, 612 have recovered and 198 have passed away.

Haha. What's the point in protecting oneself from a mere coronavirus, when communal virus has already possessed the body.
Thousands of Americans,including those with serious illness that is cancer, have helped slow spread of Coronavirus by delaying procedure and trwatments. We must safely reopen our country and hospitals soon- we owe it to those who have made these sacrifices.
Coronavirus known to world from Jan, death from Feb but Modi Govt was busy in politics of election, Namaste trump, CAA NRC, Riot, S/Bagh, topple MP Govt, buy Gujarat MLA in news.. and shocked, Govt allowed export of PPE till end March. And now passing blame, doing gimmicks.
