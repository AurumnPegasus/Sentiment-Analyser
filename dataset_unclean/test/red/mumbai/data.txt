We live in strange times where "I can't breathe" is a cry of both corona virus and racism. We live in strange times where expensive face-recognition systems lay broken by cloth masks that filter luck. We live in strange times where weak Goliaths fall and strong Davids rise.
Why bother with testing in that case? These will not be COVID-19 patients - they will just be people with a positive Coronavirus test result! So much confusion - just to scare people and propagate fear!
