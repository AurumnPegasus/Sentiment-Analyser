Novel CORONA virus frustations 
@traveltriangle when the pandemic of corona virus is spread, our prime minister and the WHO has requested people to refrain from travelling unnecessarily, even airlines have cancelled to and fro flights on bagdogra sector
WHO has declared corona virus as pandemic and requested people not to travel unnecessarily. Our travel agent namely travel triangle is refusing to refund us the initial deposit amount as it is against their cancellation policy.
They say it is against their cancellation policy to give back refund, we do not understand why we should travel in such epidemic spread of corona virus and secondly how should we reach there, when flights are cancelled,
WHO has declared corona virus a pandemic, according to government directives flights have been cancelled on bagdogra sector and both spice jet and go air have initiated a full refund of the air fare for to and fro fares. Bhutan is closed for tourist for 15 days

Is that all we think of? Country and world is grappling with the global scourge ofc corona virus and BCCI and cricketers only think of playing cricket. It's like Nero fiddling while Rome was burning. Shortsighted and greedy.
BCCI is crazy? Country is grappling with the Corona virus and these fools want to play cricket.

If you’re traveling, use this to track the corona virus. 
The corona virus,when it falls on a metal surface,will live for 12hr,so washing hands with soap and water well will do the trick. Corona virus when it falls on fabrics stays for 9hr so washing clothes or exposing them to the sun for 2hr is enough for the purpose of killing him.
Unicef The corona virus is large in size with a cell diameter of 400-500 micro, so any mask prevents its entry so there is no need to exploit pharmacists to trade with muzzles. The virus does not settle in the air, but on the ground, so it is not transmitted by the air.
