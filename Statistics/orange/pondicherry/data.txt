It is true that the corona virus has emerged from China and spread to India and the world. On the very day of India's independence,the corona virus came into India as a politician. The fact is that when the world's first politician arrived,the coronavirus appeared in the world.
After thousands of people are infected with the virus, they give long interviews in magazines and television and treat them like male sons. They are more harmful than the Corona virus, which kills people's lives.

It is true that the corona virus has emerged from China and spread to India and the world. On the very day of India's independence,the corona virus came into India as a politician. The fact is that when the world's first politician arrived,the coronavirus appeared in the world.
After thousands of people are infected with the virus, they give long interviews in magazines and television and treat them like male sons. They are more harmful than the Corona virus, which kills people's lives.
